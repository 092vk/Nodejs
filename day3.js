// so together with nodejs , we get npm(node package manager )

/*whenever we make a project - do npm init , this creates a package.json file ,
 which keeps the record of all the libraries and dependices which we are using in our project */


 console.log("hello js , this is my script");

 //this file will run if you give the command "npm run myscript"
// ***** so lets say we are making a project and instead of asking the devs to install all the dependiecs i can simply create a script and ask the devs to run it , that script will contain all the commands to install the dependies ******

//nodejs doesnt have all the (browser specific , ui specific ) commands of js . like alert and window object
