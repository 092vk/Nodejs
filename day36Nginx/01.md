NGINX or ENGINEX - it is a powerful web server that uses a non-threaded , event-driven architecture


it can also do 
--> load balancing 
-->HTTP caching 
-->reverse proxy


--> Forward Proxy --think of it as vpn , many users connect with vpn server which in turn is connected to a server like google 
--> Reverse Proxy -- this is just opposite , here the vpn is called reverse proxy server (most famous NIGINX ) , in this the proxy server does not know which server it has to send data to , it has many servers connected to it , we will write the code about which server it will choose , 

--> use of proxy servers -- lets say you are just using one server , now if user increase , this will clog the server and it will become slow, to avoid this , we use proxy server as many servers will be connected to it and it will distribute the requests into several servers .also it protects the server as there is a proxy server in between , which can protect you from outage .



-->HTTP caching -- lets say someone requested a image , now NIGINX will save it in its cache , so if someone requests the same thing instead of making the request again , it will fetch the result from its cache only 


** NIGINX is connected with many users and many servers ****
--> example : google uses lots of products , so it uses proxy servers to direct the search requests to one server , while request to /maps to other servers , /youtube to other servers 



<!-- Use of NIGINX -->
1.can handle 10k requests 
2.cache http requests 
3.act as reverse proxy 
4.act as load balancer 
5.act as api gateway
6.server and cache static files like images , videos etc 
7.hanldle ssl certificates etc
